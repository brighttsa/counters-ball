## 2026-09-11 — Campaign, interface and game feel

Turned the visual-direction prototype into a playable game.

### Added
- **Logo & brand**: crown-cap badge with the Black Star, chalk flick-streaks and
  a sticker wordmark (`assets/counters-ball-logo.svg`), animated on the title
  screen; matching favicon.
- **Six-venue campaign** (`src/levels/`): schoolyard, kiosk, veranda, roadside,
  harmattan lorry station, night final — each with its own surface, lighting
  preset, backdrop, obstacles, rules and opponent kid.
- **AI opponent** (`ai-opponent-shot-planner.js`): plans by rehearsal on a
  cloned physics table (ghost-ball aims, clearances, random samples scored by
  simulated outcome). Five difficulties from `rookie` to `champion`, separated by
  search budget, aiming error and blunder chance. The performer scans the caps,
  draws back and flicks so it reads like a person.
- **Match rules**: turn order, per-side flick budgets, goals-to-win, kickoffs,
  full-time results and three stars (win · clean sheet · win within budget).
- **Progression**: stars and sound preference in localStorage; venues unlock in
  order; 2-player hot-seat mode on any table.
- **Interface**: title with live AI-vs-AI attract match, level select, intro
  card, in-match HUD, pause menu, results card with stars revealed one by one,
  and a looping chalk hand that teaches the drag on level 1.
- **Game feel**: hit-stop on strikes, slow motion on shots at goal, spring
  squash/lean/wobble on caps and goals, ball hop, dust puffs, ball dust trail,
  goal confetti that settles on the table, camera director (attract / crane-in
  intro / breathing play / goal push-in) with flick kicks and trauma shake.
- **Audio**: fully procedural Web Audio — cap clinks, paper thwacks, wood
  knocks, stone clacks, glass tinks, pea whistle, crowd swell, star dings, plus
  day/harmattan/night ambience beds.

### Changed
- `src/` reorganised into `core/ levels/ scene/ gameplay/ fx/ audio/ ui/`.
- Physics moved to a fixed 240 Hz step with impact/wall events, friction scaling
  per venue and snapshot/clone support so AI rehearsal matches real play.
- Table surfaces generalised from cardboard-only to cardboard, plywood and a
  carved school desk; backdrops and lighting are now per-venue presets.
- Aim visuals extracted so the human input and the AI share one presentation.

### Fixed
- Boot crash: the first animation frame could produce a negative `dt`, sending
  the thinking AI's cap-scan index to -1 (`TypeError` on `.body`). `dt` is now
  clamped at 0 and the scan timer can't go negative.
- Physics: caps pushed together could come to rest interpenetrating and stay
  that way, because resting pairs skipped the overlap test. Overlap is now
  checked first (squared distance, so it stays cheap).
- Leaving the results screen early no longer lets pending star-reveal sounds
  fire into the next screen.
- The title-screen AI match restarts itself if it ever runs out of flicks
  instead of freezing.
- AI fallback shot now uses the cap nearest the ball; light shadow maps are
  disposed explicitly on venue change.
- Pointer capture and single-pointer ownership (a second touch can no longer
  hijack a drag).
- Swept goal-line test replaces the positional check (no tunnelling at speed).
- Pixel ratio refreshed on resize; dust sprite texture shared.
